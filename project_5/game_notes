Ideas for another adventure game.

I could do a range of rooms or geographic locations

I could include actions for moving searching fighting

I could insert variables that change into each action decision

I could make the game success be based on accumulating treasure, need x amount to escape, etc

More ways to end game or win it

make a back-pack for item acquisition. Stored as an array

the items could be methods that affect specific scenarios?


What would be a fun thing to play? If I were plying this game, what would I want to be able to do?

Assuming random rooms and monsters as a rule (no revisiting specifics past the original encounter)

Display could be improved to increase readability

weapon choice vs creature type (sword no good on flying creature for example)
weapons have limited uses, -1 each time until it breaks
creatures have different strengths/deficiencies
some creatures heal ()
some items heal (if healing_properties?)

What would make a game unique? What do you build or achieve? the environment has no
linear goal, but you could collect items that total to a game exit.
Game items appear randomly but only once (unless obstacle/healing)
rather make it 2 item types, artifacts and obstacle/healing

one action is a back pack

outline:

game loop:
  describe room
  action prompt
    search, move, backpack, fight, note
  conditional situation
  win/lose assess
  repeat


  This cold be done with land types, like Catan, each has it's own resources that
  you can use in various individual and combined ways.
  "You are in a #{land type}, #{weather condition}, #{ominous/mysterious quality}. #{dangerlevel}"
  if danger level > 0 increasing likelihood of monsters.

  number_of_lands_explored  = 1
  treasure_count            = 0
  backpack                  = []
  health                    = 5
  escaped                   = false
  monster                   = false
  current_land              = create_land
